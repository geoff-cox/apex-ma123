  <title>Integration</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have spent considerable time considering the derivatives of a function and their applications.
      In the following chapters,
      we are going to starting thinking in
      <q>the other direction.</q> That is,
      given a function <m>f(x)</m>,
      we are going to consider functions <m>F(x)</m> such that <m>F'(x) = f(x)</m>.
      There are numerous reasons this will prove to be useful:
      these functions will help us compute area,
      volume, mass, force, pressure, work, and much more.

  <conclusion>
    <p>
      We started this chapter learning about antiderivatives and indefinite integrals.
      We then seemed to change focus by looking at areas between the graph of a function and the <m>x</m>-axis.
      We defined these areas as the definite integral of the function,
      using a notation very similar to the notation of the indefinite integral.
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tied these two seemingly separate concepts together:
      we can find areas under a curve,
      <ie/>, we can evaluate a definite integral, using antiderivatives.
    </p>

    <p>
      We ended the chapter by noting that antiderivatives are sometimes more than difficult to find:
      they are impossible.
      Therefore we developed numerical techniques that gave us good approximations of definite integrals.
